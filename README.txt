##Bruterin

Brute force tool for finding Ethereum keys holding a balance. Will output generate public addresses to console in linear time and writes an address with a private key to a text file in the extremely
unlikely event a balance is found.<br>

More of an indulgence in curiousity and example of the strength of RSA cryptography than a practical hacking tool but feel free to test your luck. Not responsible for misuse.
